#IMPORTANT: Due to Pin and Kernel dependency issues, ZSim+NVMain only runs in Ubuntu 12

1) Run the install.sh script, and add all the environment variables to ~/.bashrc

2) Make Pin:
2a) $PINPATH/source/tools/
2b) make -j16
2c) For Pin injection mode, run this command as root: echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

3) FIX: In $NVMAINPATH/SConscript, comment out line "from gem5_scons import Transform"

3) Build NVMain (at $NVMAINPATH): scons -j16

4) Build ZSim (at $ZSIMPATH): scons -j16

5) Test Run: ./build/opt/zsim test/simple.cfg
